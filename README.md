📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a book sales dataset using Python. The goal is to understand sales patterns and trends through data visualization, especially by grouping related variables.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Pandas – for data loading, cleaning, and grouping

Matplotlib – for basic data visualization

Seaborn – for advanced and more readable visualizations

🔍 Analysis Performed

Loaded the book sales dataset into a Pandas DataFrame

Explored the structure of the data (columns, data types, missing values)

Used groupby() to aggregate data such as:

Published year by publisher

Author and book rating

total_gross_sale_by_author

Created visualizations (bar charts, line scatter plot) to show grouped insights

📈 Visualizations

The visualizations help to:

Distribution of publishing year using Histogram

Genre by Book Rating Count

Sales price by unit sold using Scatter plot 

All plots were generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn after grouping the data with Pandas.
